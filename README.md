# TasmotaFriendshipLamp

Work in Progress

This documents how to make a friendship lamp from inexpensive parts. Inspired by UncommonGoods which sell for $175 a set.  These can be made for $10 each and have more features, such as Alexa support. 

Parts:
```
Wemos D1 Mini (x2) - You can get for about $3 each on Aliexpress or Amazon. Real or knockoffs work
WS2812 LEDs - A couple bucks each. I am using an 8 LED ring for each. 
Touch Switch - Tin Foil and Resister (not done yet)
```
```
Software:
Tasmota - You need to compile script support instead of rules. Will post a compiled bin here. Or use https://github.com/benzino77/tasmocompiler
```
